    <string name="article_text">Technology has always been a product of ingenuity and curiosity.
        Although a great tool for exploring the unknown, it still has a long way to go.
        The human body exists within a universe whose fundamental laws are
        still largely a mystery, a subject ripe for research.
        With its laws, its order, its chaos, its mysteries, the body is a mirror of the universe.<br/><br/>

        Throughout history, doctors have always used the technologies at their disposal to read this universe –
        without ever forgetting the most important tool of all, one beyond the reach of any artificial
        intelligence even today: intuition.Esaote’s purpose has always been to create instruments that
        help doctors read our physical universe more clearly – and,like any good doctor, it has sought to
        better itself over the thirty years or so of its existence.
